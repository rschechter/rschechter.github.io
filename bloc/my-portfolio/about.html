     <div class="about-body-paragraphs">
       <p class="section-tagline">Who am I?</p>
       <p class="about-body-copy">I’m a creative person in pretty much all that I
         set out to do, and an artist in many senses of the word. I have always
         loved singing and dancing and have taken these interests with me through
         years of school and summer camp. I have also always had a passion for visual
         arts starting when I was an elementary school student, turning book reports
         into intricate artistic masterpieces which eventually lead to becoming an
         art major in college.</p>
       <p class="about-body-copy">But I never considered myself to be a “free-spirit artist.”
         I like to follow a choreographed dance routine and I like to sketch with a pencil
         and eraser before any paint reaches the canvas. I like to map out my ideas and I
         like to have a plan, I love notebooks (especially those that have floral designs
         on the cover) and I have a guilty pleasure for writing lists. I always knew that
         I was an interesting mix of the right and left brains, but I never realized that
         I could turn this dichotomy into a profession. Then I stumbled across UX design.</p>
       <p class="section-tagline">Let's backtrack for a second.</p>
       <p class="about-body-copy">I went to a small university and majored in Studio Art.
         I took classes in painting, drawing, 3D design, graphic design and color theory,
         among many others. I went through numerous career ideas while in undergrad, from
         architect to interior designer to art director to exhibition designer. Following
         my college graduation I was an exhibition design intern at the American Museum of
         Natural History in New York City where I was able to combine design with the human
         experience in a way that I hadn’t been exposed to before. But as much as I loved
         living my own personal Night at the Museum, I felt more removed from my ‘end user’
         than I initially thought I would.  What I wanted was to be more of a hands-on designer,
         working closely with my clients, listening to and solving design challenges that affect
         and influence people every day.</p>
        <p class="section-tagline">The epiphany:</p>
        <p class="about-body-copy">I discovered companies like IDEO and Frog Design and I became
          fascinated with innovation design consultancies and the notion of human centered design.
          I didn’t quite know what this world was all about, but I knew that I wanted to be a part
          of it. I finally settled on the field of UX design after finding that I shared a common
          love with the people at these agencies of crafting complete and satisfying user experiences.
          I enrolled in Bloc’s Designer Track program where I am learning UX and UI design along with
          the fundamentals of frontend development, and I haven’t looked back since.</p>
        <p class="about-body-copy">I am utilizing both my right and left brains every day by becoming well versed in user
          research, user experience and visual design. I am excited by all that this field has to
          offer, and I am looking forward to future opportunities.</p>
