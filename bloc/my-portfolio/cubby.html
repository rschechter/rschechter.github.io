       <h3>Problem</h3>
       <p class="intro-text-body">The client expressed interest in the cloud storage app market,
         but did not have a clear vision of what they wanted their app to be or even who their target
         audience is. I needed to figure out a target audience based on gaps in the market, and to
         create an application that has the correct combination of cloud storage features to satisfy
         this group. Some specific features that the client asked to be included were saving existing
         content, creating original content, organizing any content, uploading content, and collaboration.</p>
     </section>
     <section class="solution">
       <img src="Images/solution-back.png"
       <h3>Solution</h3>
       <p class="intro-text-body">By discovering that students are under-represented in the cloud storage
          market through user research and a competitive analysis, I was able to create Cubby and include
          the specific features that the client asked for. Cubby offers students the ability to create and
          share original content, upload and share existing content, and browse for and save existing content
          from the internet. All of these features also allow students to collaborate with their peers and
          teachers by sharing the files, folders, or boards in their Cubby.</p>

         <h4>User Survey</h4>
         <p class="case-study-text">I began by creating a user survey and distributing it to friends and
           contacts by posting on social media channels, various Slack groups and sending out some emails.
           My survey reached 60 participants, and my objective with the survey was to learn the following: </p>
         <div class="survey-questions">
           <ul>
             <li>Which cloud storage apps users have and use</li>

             <li>What are some tasks that the user hopes to accomplish while using a cloud storage app</li>
             <li>Which cloud storage apps does the user use for collaboration</li>
             <li>What is the user’s age</li>

         <p class="case-study-text">To gain a deeper understanding of my users, I asked some more in-depth questions to
           two individuals and used that data to generate user personas which will more specifically capture Cubby’s target audience.</p>

           <p class="persona-titles">Marcus is a 21 year old student in Philadelphia, PA.</p>
           <img src="Images/Marcus-persona.png">
           <p class="case-study-text">Marcus is a biology student at a top university and planning on pursuing medicine after graduation. He
             has a lot going on now - class work, lab work and the medical school application process. He is stressed and has a lot on his plate,
             and could definitely use a worthwhile and easy solution to help him stay organized and on top of all of his to-dos.</p>
           <p class="regular-bold-title">Goals</p>
           <p class="case-study-text">1. To be able to organize all of his files and collaborate with classmates on group projects</p>

           <p class="regular-bold-title">Frustrations</p>
           <p class="case-study-text">1. He is coming close to his storage capacity in the cloud storage app he uses now and he doesn't
             want to pay for the more expensive plan with additional storage - he is a student after all!</p>
           <p class="case-study-text">2. With the apps he uses, he can see shared files but cannot edit them in real time. He would need to
             download the file or document, make changes and then upload it again, and he doesn't find this method so practical.</p>

            to organize to-buy baby items and other resources and ideas regarding her upcoming baby.</p>
            <p class="regular-bold-title">Goals</p>
            <p class="case-study-text">1. To organize patient information and make everything easily referenceable and to have backups of her patients’ personal files</p>
            <p class="case-study-text">2. To collect pre-existing content from the internet such as images or articles relating to her personal life (more specifically, her soon-to-be new baby)</p>
            <p class="regular-bold-title">Frustrations</p>
            <p class="case-study-text">1. She doesn’t always feel that she is being provided with new content when she’s trying to collect ideas – she seems to be getting a lot of the same results in her searches</p>

         <p class="case-study-text">After creating these personas, I decided to only include students as Cubby’s target audience so
           that I’d be able to focus exclusively on this group and create an app that caters to all of their needs.</p>

         <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
         <p class="case-study-text">It happens to be that the features that the client had asked for in their brief are also found
           within the three cloud-storage apps that my users use most: Pinterest; for browsing, saving and sharing content from the
           internet, Dropbox; for uploading and sharing users’ pre-existing content, and Google Drive; for creating and sharing
           original content. I chose to take a closer look at these three apps by conducting a SWOT analysis, determining who their
           target audience is, what their positioning is, and what are some things that make them different from the competition.
           Here are some of my findings:</p>

         <h4>User Stories & Flows</h4>
         <p class="case-study-text">After I developed a better understanding of who my users are and what they might be interested
           in when it comes to this cloud storage app, I created user stories to map out different tasks that a user might want to
           accomplish while using the app. I followed this exercise with a series of user flows which visually illustrate the journey
           that a user will take via the app to complete these tasks. </p>

         <h4>User Testing Round 1</h4>
         <p class="case-study-text">At this point, I brought my wireframes to three users to see how they each might interact with them.
           My testers gave me some helpful ideas of features and details to incorporate into the designs. The feedback I received was to add:</p>
         <div class="test-result-card">
           <p class="case-study-text">A search bar in the upload window as well as a “drag and drop” option for easy uploads</p>

         <div class="test-result-card">
           <p class="case-study-text">An indication that all content is automatically saved</p>
         </div>
         <div class="test-result-card">
           <p class="case-study-text">An alteration to the onboarding process so that the main screen features a hero image or a different large
             graphic element, with either “sign in” or “sign up” with another button visible for the other option</p>
         </div>
         <img src="Images/user-testing-back.png">
          <p class="case-study-text">This exercise was helpful for me because not only did I receive good feedback about design details that I
            would have otherwise overlooked, but I became more comfortable with other people viewing and interacting with my work.</p>

         <h4>Preference Tests</h4>
         <p class="case-study-text">As my wireframes became more polished, I ran some preference tests to help me decide on some details in my design.
           Here are two of the images that I showed testers:</p>
         <div>
           <img src="Images/Pref-test-back.png">
           <img src="Images/Pref-test-1.png">
           <p class="img-label">Test 1: which icon color do you prefer?</p>
           <p class="case-study-text">All three of my testers told me that they liked the turquoise icons better than the yellow  ones, because they
             were easier to see. I had thought this as well, but really wanted to figure out a way to include this yellow in my designs as I thought
             it was a nice accent color to the blues and turquoises, but I ultimately decided to let it go and just stick with the turquoise for
             readability purposes.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
           <img src="Images/Pref-test-2.png">
           <p class="img-label">Test 2: which card shape do you prefer?</p>
           <p class="case-study-text">Two of my testers told me that they liked option 1 best, and one tester chose option 2. I decided to choose
             option 1 as I felt that the style aligned best with the overall brand. It evoked the greatest sense of simplicity which is something I
             was trying to achieve, and it gave the whole interface a modern and clean look.</p>

         <h4>Prototypes</h4>
         <p class="case-study-text">After my mockups were completed, I used the prototyping tool on Figma to connect them to one another thereby
           enabling a user to test out the flow of the mockups. This phase was to help me as the designer understand the user’s ability to navigate
           the interface and therefore make tweaks to the designs if necessary.</p>

         <h4>User Testing Round 2</h4>
         <p class="case-study-text">I had someone who was acting as the “senior designer” critique Cubby at this stage, and I got a lot of important
           feedback that I am planning on incorporating into this project in a future iteration. Here are some changes/additions I have made based off
           of his feedback so far:</p>
         <img src="Images/user-testing-2-back.png">
         <div class="testing-card">
           <p class="testing-label">Desktop</p>
           <ol>
             <li>1. Change the combination of typefaces on the dashboard cards to be only one typeface to help improve readability</li>
             <li>2. Swap out dividing line of the “Browse” window on the desktop dashboard for a solid color in that section</li>
           </ol>
           <p class="img-label">Before</p>
           <img src="Images/Desktop-Before.png">

         <div class="testing-card">
           <p class="testing-label">Mobile</p>
           <ol>
             <li>1. Change the combination of typefaces on the dashboard cards to be only one typeface to help improve readability</li>
             <li>2. Modify the toolbar at the bottom of the mobile dashboard so that it doesn’t look dated</li>
           </ol>
           <p class="img-label">Before</p>
           <img src="Images/Mobile-Before.png">

           <img src="Images/Mobile-After.png">
         </div>
         <p class="case-study-text">To improve this project in the future, I hope to  build out the “how it works” page (as indicated with a button on
           the landing page) to explain the product’s business model and a little more about how the product will work.</p>

         <p class="case-study-text">I learned a lot while doing this project. I was really able to develop more of a hands-on understanding
           to the design process and it was interesting to see how one step leads to the next in a way that I feel truly makes sense. I
           found the multiple rounds of testing and iteration to be very productive and useful, and I am feeling much more comfortable
           with getting users’ feedback on different phases of the project. I am excited to incorporate these steps and all of the knowledge
           that I have gained into future projects.</p>
