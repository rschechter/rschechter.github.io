       <h3>Problem</h3>
       <p class="problem-body">The client expressed interest in the cloud storage app market,
         but did not have a clear vision of what they wanted their app to be or even who their target
         audience is. I needed to figure out a target audience based on gaps in the market, and to
         create an application that has the correct combination of cloud storage features to satisfy
         this group. Some specific features that the client asked to be included were saving existing
         content, creating original content, organizing any content, uploading content, and collaboration.</p>
     </section>
     <section class="solution">
       <h3>Solution</h3>
       <p class="solution-body">By discovering that students are under-represented in the cloud storage
          market through user research and a competitive analysis, I was able to create Cubby and include
          the specific features that the client asked for. Cubby offers students the ability to create and
          share original content, upload and share existing content, and browse for and save existing content
          from the internet. All of these features also allow students to collaborate with their peers and
          teachers by sharing the files, folders, or boards in their Cubby.</p>

         <h4>User Survey</h4>
         <p class="case-study-text">I began by creating a user survey and distributing it to friends and
           contacts by posting on social media channels, various Slack groups and sending out some emails.
           My survey reached 60 participants, and my objective with the survey was to learn the following: </p>
         <div class="survey-questions">
           <ul>
             <li>Which cloud storage apps users have and use</li>
             <li>What a user’s primary purpose is for using a cloud storage app</li>
             <li>What are some tasks that the user hopes to accomplish while using a cloud storage app</li>
             <li>Which cloud storage apps does the user use for collaboration</li>
             <li>What is the user’s age</li>
             <li>What is the user’s current employment status</li>
           </ul>
         </div>
         <div class="survey-results">
           <p class="survey-1">I learned a lot from the survey results. Some of my key findings about my users were:</p>
            <div class="percent-data">
              <h2 class="percent">96%</h2>

         <h4>User Personas</h4>
         <p class="case-study-text">To gain a deeper understanding of my users, I asked some more in-depth questions to
           two individuals and used that data to generate user personas which will more specifically capture Cubby’s target audience.</p>
         <div class="personas">
         </div>
         <p class="case-study-text">After creating these personas, I decided to only include students as Cubby’s target audience so
           that I’d be able to focus exclusively on this group and create an app that caters to all of their needs.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="textblock">
         <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
         <p class="case-study-text">It happens to be that the features that the client had asked for in their brief are also found
           within the three cloud-storage apps that my users use most: Pinterest; for browsing, saving and sharing content from the
           internet, Dropbox; for uploading and sharing users’ pre-existing content, and Google Drive; for creating and sharing
           original content. I chose these three apps to take a closer look at by conducting a SWOT analysis, determining who their
           target audience is, what their positioning is, and what are some things that make them different from the competition.
           Here are some of my findings:</p>

         <h4>User Stories & Flows</h4>
         <p class="case-study-text">After I developed a better understanding of who my users are and what they might be interested
           in when it comes to this cloud storage app, I created user stories to map out different tasks that a user might want to
           accomplish while using the app. I followed this exercise with a series of user flows which visually illustrate the journey
           that a user will take via the app to complete these tasks. </p>

       <div class="textblock">
         <h4>Wireframes</h4>
         <p class="case-study-text">Based on all previous research, I developed a series of hand-sketches which turned into wireframes
           to begin visualizing layout of the app.</p>
           <div class="wireframes">
             <img src="">
             <p class="img-label">Dashboard + create content</p>

       <div class="textblock">
         <h4>User Testing Round 1</h4>
         <p class="case-study-text">At this point, I brought my wireframes to three users to see how they each might interact with them.
           My testers gave me some helpful ideas of features and details to incorporate into the designs. The feedback I received was to add:</p>
         <div class="test-result-card">
           <p class="case-study-text">A search bar in the upload window as well as a “drag and drop” option for easy uploads</p>
         </div>
         <div class="test-result-card">
           <p class="case-study-text">An indication that all content is automatically saved</p>
         </div>
         <div class="test-result-card">
           <p class="case-study-text">An alteration to the onboarding process so that the main screen features a hero image or a different large
             graphic element, with either “sign in” or “sign up” with another button visible for the other option</p>
         </div>
          <p class="case-study-text">This exercise was helpful for me because not only did I receive good feedback about design details that I
            would have otherwise overlooked, but I became more comfortable with other people viewing and interacting with my work.</p>

       <div class="textblock">
         <p class="case-study-text">Now that l had a grasp on who my target audience was and what the gist of the app was all about,
           I began the branding phase.</p>
         <p class="case-study-text">I decided to call this app “Cubby” as its target audience is students, and a cubby is a common
           classroom resource used to store and organize many different school-related things. My objective with this brand was to
           create a sense of organization and clarity which will help users block out distractions and maximize their productivity.</p>
         <div>
           <h4>Designing the Logo</h4>
           <p class="case-study-text">I wanted the logo to be modern, simple and coherent as to not cause any visual distractions to
             the user. I started out by trying to incorporate the letter “C” or the whole word “Cubby” into squares and rectangles.</p>
           <img src="">
           <p class="case-study-text">I eventually landed on these two design options and I decided to go with option 1 as I found it
             to be more visually interesting, and some feedback I sought out matched this opinion.</p>

           <h4>Color Palette</h4>
           <!--not an image but also text is formatted exactly.. what to do here? -->
         </div>
         <p class="case-study-text">I brought some selected colors into the logo and produced the following outcome:</p>

       <div class="textblock">
         <h4>Mockups</h4>
         <p class="case-study-text">Based on feedback from my wireframes and style guide, I created high-fidelity mockups using
           Figma to depict what the interfaces of specific screens will look like while using Cubby.</p>
           <div class="mockups">
             <img src="">
             <p class="img-label">Landing page + sign up</p>

       <div class="textblock">
         <h4>Preference Tests</h4>
         <p class="case-study-text">As my wireframes became more polished, I ran some preference tests to help me decide on some details in my design.
           Here are two of the images that I showed testers:</p>
         <div>
           <img src="">
           <p class="img-label">Test 1: which icon color do you prefer?</p>
           <p class="case-study-text">All three of my testers told me that they liked the turquoise icons better than the yellow  ones, because they
             were easier to see. I had thought this as well, but really wanted to figure out a way to include this yellow in my designs as I thought
             it was a nice accent color to the blues and turquoises, but I ultimately decided to let it go and just stick with the turquoise for
             readability purposes.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
           <img src="">
           <p class="img-label">Test 2: which card shape do you prefer?</p>
           <p class="case-study-text">Two of my testers told me that they liked option 1 best, and one tester chose option 2. I decided to choose
             option 1 as I felt that the style aligned best with the overall brand. It evoked the greatest sense of simplicity which is something I
             was trying to achieve, and it gave the whole interface a modern and clean look </p>
         </div>
       </div>
       <div class="textblock">
         <h4>User Testing Round 2-text"</h4>
         <p class="case-study-text">I had someone acting as the “senior designer” critique this project at this stage, and I got a lot of important
           feedback that I am planning on incorporate into this project in a future iteration. Here are some changes/additions I have made based off
           of his feedback:</p>
         <div class="testing-card">
           <p class="testing-label">Desktop</p>
           <ol>
             <li>1. Change the combination of typefaces on the dashboard cards to be only one typeface to help improve readability</li>
             <li>2. Swap out dividing line of the “Browse” window on the desktop dashboard for a solid color in that section</li>
           </ol>
           <p class="img-label">Before</p>
           <img src="">
           <p class="img-label">After</p>
           <img src="">
         </div>
         <div class="testing-card">
           <p class="testing-label">Mobile</p>
           <ol>
             <li>1. Change the combination of typefaces on the dashboard cards to be only one typeface to help improve readability</li>
             <li>2. Modify the toolbar at the bottom of the mobile dashboard so that it doesn’t look dated</li>
           </ol>
           <p class="img-label">Before</p>
           <img src="">
           <p class="img-label">After</p>
           <img src="">
         </div>
         <p class="case-study-text">To improve this project in the future, I hope to  build out the “how it works” page (as indicated with a button on
           the landing page) to explain the product’s business model and a little more about how the product will work.</p>

       <div class="textblock">
         <h4 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
         <p class="case-study-text">I learned a lot while doing this project. I was really able to develop more of a hands-on understanding
           to the design process and it was interesting to see how one step leads to the next in a way that I feel truly makes sense. I
           found the multiple rounds of testing and iteration to be very productive and useful, and I am feeling much more comfortable
           with getting users’ feedback on different phases of the project. I am excited to incorporate these steps and all of the knowledge
           that I have gained into future projects.</p>
